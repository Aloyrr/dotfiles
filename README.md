My Starship toml file


Hello, 

This is my configured starship toml file. I will be sharing the toml file in this repo. 

To install starship:

Visit this link --> https://starship.rs/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation

To place this in your config (macOS / Linux) 

1. open `~/.config/starship.toml` with your prefered editor 
2. Paste my toml file in 

I did this process with neovim:

1. `nvim ~/.config/starship.toml` 
2. `i` for insert mode 
3. paste my toml 
4. `esc` to exit insert mode 
5. `:wq` to save & quit 

If you mess up during this process 

Use `:q!` to exit without saving 


what it looks like:
